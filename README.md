Like the title says this is my attempt of learning gazebo
# Build/ Using

1. `cd /GazeboLearning`

2. `colcon build --cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=ON`

3. `source install/setup.bash`

4. `ros2 launch ros_gz_example_bringup diff_drive.launch.py`

# Testing
To send a raw command over the cli to the active node you can do `ign topic -t "/Direction" -m ignition.msgs.Twist -p "linear: {x: 0.5}, angular: {z: 0.05}"`

# Testing bridge
Run this command in another terminal (have gazebo sim running as well). This command sends the direction value over to the gazebo side from the ros communictation stack.

`ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge /Direction@geometry_msgs/msg/Twist@ignition.msgs.Twist`

A ros command that should be sent throuhg the bridge

`ros2 topic pub /Direction geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"`
